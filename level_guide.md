# Base Game Levels

## Devil's Canyon Chapter 1
Triggers to progress level:

(1) collect the second hint
* unlock 2nd map section

(2a) dad hides coin-tutorial gunman, delivers lines
* unlocks 3rd map section
* can be skipped with an early (2c) but map section won't unlock until after dad knifes enemy

(2b) collect the fourth hint
* unlocks coin-only showdown mode
* less helpful than (2c)

(2c) coin the horse to kick the gunwoman
* permanently unlocks full showdown mode
* necessary for final teleport
* can be skipped by doing (2a) and (3)

(3) Lower rope ladder for dad
* unlocks 4th map section

(4) Dad enters courtyard (and you climb courtyard ladder?)
* unlocks 5th map section

(5) Coin the cliff gunman after dad instructs you to
* unlocks final map section
* can be skipped if you did (2c) and you teleport to do (6) while dad is moving from courtyard bush to the building 

(6) Activate the mechanism
* bring dad to level end
* doing at the wrong times can cause the mission to fail or soft lock. Do in normal sequence or the skip described in (5)

(7) Dad and you arrive at final meetup point
* level ends


## Byers Pass
Triggers for unlocking abilities:
* Cooper's knife: enter the knife tutorial area
* Cooper's guns: enter the gun tutorial area
* McCoy: kill/KO one of the gunmen by him
* McCoy's bag: read the hint by the tree bridge, or step onto the tree bridge
* McCoy's gun: go near the train tracks after the bag tutorial

Hints appear after about a second after the level starts. Teleporting off the train roof before the hints appear may cause Cooper to get stuck in the air.

Blowing up the boulder will typically cause an alarm preventing you from finishing the level right away. However, if your characters are both inside the meetup area with no alarm triggered when you throw the dynamite at the boulder, one of the ending cutscenes will play right after the cutscene of the boulder exploding. If you skip this ending cutscene, you immediately end the level. 

Skipping the cutscene before the boulder explodes resumes the level rather than ending it. Watching the full boulder & ending cutscenes will also resume the level.


## Flagstone
Each target has a potential environmental kill which won't cause alarm: 
* Drop the church bell
* Drop the loose wall
* Poison the whiskey
* Anger the bull


## O'Hara Ranch
Shooting a lantern-holder as they stand over an oil patch will kill all characters on the patch and not trigger an alarm.

Trees seem to not block McCoy's snipe. For instance, you can snipe the top-right long coat from the beginning or from the chicken coop.

The meetup can be triggered by characters standing on the ground under the roof as well as on top of it.

If you invisible kill-carry the long coat in the field from the left side with Hector, you're close enough to the bushes to drop the long coat where you are and his body will disappear.


## Eagle Falls
If any characters are on the left side of the bridge when you blow it up, you'll fail the mission. Characters can stand on the right side of the bridge section that collapses when it does so and they'll get teleported to the edge of the closest non-collapsed part.

Blowing up the bridge doesn't cause an alarm.


## Devil's Canyon Chapter 2
You have no normal attack to use for ghost setting, but you can still create a ghost to perform glitches at doors and interactables.


## Baton Rouge
The meetup near Kate isn't necessary.


## Mississippi River
Rescuing your characters:
* Isabelle can teleport out of her cage and will gain permanent invisibility if you do so. This won't deactivate by walking through a door.
* Unlock Cooper by killing the two enemies shooting the boat from the sandbags then having a character stand on the front of the boat.
* Unlock McCoy by entering his trapdoor.
* The objectives for freeing Hector and Kate won't be fulfilled if you teleport them out of their cages. However, they will if you fly them out. You can only fly them out in certain directions because they can collide with parts of the cage.


## New Orleans
The normal sequence needed is to get the correct letter, meetup, then examine the desk in the locked shed to beat the level.

The letter and meetup can be skipped by using the out-of-bounds glitch to run straight to the shed desk.

The letter you need is randomly assigned to one of the 3 targets upon loading the level. Reloading a save even at the very beginning of the level won't reset who has it. You can tell if you have collected the correct letter by the dialogue played.

Kate can pickpocket letters.

Different lines of dialogue play based on which character grabs a letter, enters the shed, and examines the desk. These lines are very similar length though. Dialogue will trigger when you get near a letter carrier, but this can be skipped by killing or knocking out the carrier.

The meetup area is very wide. It can be triggered from a spot on the other side of the fence (in the letter carrier's area) and can also use a Ghost Meetup on the nearby wall.


## Queen's Nest
Wayne is unlocked by passing through his cell door with a character or showdown ghost.

Igniting the Queen typically causes an alarm, however if your characters are all on the boat without an alarm when the burn cutscene plays, it'll immediately transition to the end cutscene, which you can skip and immediately end the level.


## New Orleans Docks
You can bypass the meetup at the gate by triggering the meetup on the boat first. This will mess up the camera for the last part and if you do this without a controller, you won't be able to shoot Frank and be soft locked.


## DeVitt Goldmine
The full map is unlocked when either all three characters collect their gear, or if a character/showdown ghost passes through the first gate.

Cooper and Kate are considered rescued and become available once their cell doors are unlocked (no need to pass through).

If you free Cooper/Kate before blowing up the final gate, the level ends when you blow up the gate. If you blow up the gate before rescuing them, you'll have to do an additional meetup with all characters at the gate.

Bounty Mode: Adding Cooper and Kate to your team eliminates the requirement to free them without adding a meetup at the final gate. 


## Las Piedras
Characters will die if hit by the train.

The cow cutscene (probably also the wagon cutscene) will warp both characters to a certain location. You can prevent this with a cutscene warp cancel (i.e. have them halfway up a ladder or in a door network).

The stopped train's position can be progressed by playing out this cutscene. 

For some reason it's impossible to activate invisibility during roughly the first second after this level starts.


## Casa DeVitt
DeVitt is immune to cutscene progression and will always begin in the same location. DeVitt must be alive and tied up to end the level.


## Devil's Canyon Chapter III
In the final showdown:
* Your characters have about 4 seconds to fulfill scheduled actions upon executing showdown before Frank's bodyguards shoot Cooper.
* Executing showdown will enter a cutscene state, meaning that your characters are invisible and the timer is paused.
* The bodyguards can be either killed or knocked out or mind controlled, but distractions won't work.
* The bodyguard named Bilya the Kid won't shoot Cooper and can be completely ignored.


# DLC Levels - Money for the Vultures

## Casa DeVitt (Abandoned)
A Normal or higher enemy-up setup in difficulty settings puts a gunman on the balcony above the statue, useful for a quicker invisibility and teleport.

## DeVitt Plantation
There's a door network behind the mansion from where you can do a Ghost Meetup to trigger the mid-level cutscene, but after the cutscene your characters will appear outside of the door network and be seen. This also causes a weird state where the black panels from the cutscene don't disappear.

## Eagle's Nest
Hector will automatically pick up the treasure chest after its cutscene. This can be stopped by issuing a command or doing something in showdown. However there's a tiny window just before Hector's abilities are disabled from carrying the box where he can do something in showdown (like activate invisibility) and still continue to automatically pick up the box.

You can teleport with the chest of money using a Blocked Door Teleport glitch.


# Challenges

## One Woman Army
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## Vanishing Act
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## Untitled Voodoo Mission
Hector will wake up if he takes damage.

When the mayor's on stage, the dog must be on the steps, on the stage, or right up against the side of the stage for the bark to work. Otherwise it may not work even if the mayor is in the bark radius.


## Hazards of the Trade
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## Public Transportation
Nothing particularly noteworthy.


## Three Men With No Name
The three targets are in the following locations:
* Near the boat, walking with the two long coats
* At Rosie's cabin in the top-right
* Along the road in the bottom-right near-ish where the tooth doctor is in the base level

The model target inside the bank won't react to seeing you.


## Bear Trap Triplets
Isabelle can be unlocked by stepping onto the bridge. This is optional.

The window for killing the three targets "at the same time" is narrow, they have to die within about one second of each other.


## Best Served Cold
The end won't trigger if you attack teleport the target directly onto the boat. 

The end will trigger as soon as the target is in the air as you throw him onto the boat or off of the boat.


## Rescue Aid Society
The animals can't crouch and thus can't perform most glitches.

McCoy becomes available once his cell door is unlocked.


## The Devil is in the Details
Requirements to get the murderer to appear:
* Inspect the body on the boat
* Shoot one of the chickens
* Enter the locked door (down-right across the street from Cooper/Isabelle's start location)

The murderer spawns in shortly before his cutscene plays. If you kill him before or during this cutscene, this cutscene will jump to the end cutscene and the level ends.

This level has a lot of dialogue, and the level won't progress until you've fully listened to each full dialogue. If you trigger a dialogue while another dialogue is playing, the new dialogue will queue and be played once the first dialogue finishes. 

English audio has the shortest total dialogue time. Next are German, Russian, and Chinese, respectively.


## Contact!
Enemies won't approach you while the gatling is firing.

Each guard house has two waves of alert guards. An enemy must alert inside that guard house's region to summon a wave of alert guards.

Dynamite can also be used to kill enemies.


## For a Few Bullets More
The train can be used to kill enemies.


## Bird Hunting
The light by the long coat target can be extinguished by walking over him after he's been knocked out.


## What If?
Frank has unique behavior. He won't ever attack you. If he detects you, he will cause an alarm and stand still staring at you. If you leave his vision after that, he will begin chasing after you. He will always know where you are and run toward your current location. Guards will run to the spot where Frank first saw you, but not to any other places Frank sees you after that. The guards that wander around looking for you at that first location will never stop doing so.

There's a timer of about 7 seconds before the level ends upon killing Frank. Alarm state doesn't affect this.
