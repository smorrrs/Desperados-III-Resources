## Byers Pass
Triggers for unlocking abilities:
* Cooper's knife: enter the knife tutorial area
* Cooper's guns: enter the gun tutorial area
* McCoy: kill one of the gunmen by him
* McCoy's bag: read the hint by him, or step onto the tree bridge
* McCoy's gun: go near the train tracks after the bag tutorial

Blowing up the boulder will typically cause an alarm preventing you from finishing the level right away. However, if your characters are both inside the meetup area with no alarm triggered when you throw the dynamite at the boulder, one of the ending cutscenes will play right after the cutscene of the boulder exploding. If you skip this ending cutscene, you immediately end the level. 

Skipping the cutscene before the boulder explodes resumes the level rather than ending it. Watching the full boulder & ending cutscenes will also resume the level.


## Flagstone
Each target has a potential environmental kill which won't cause alarm: 
* Drop the church bell
* Drop the loose wall
* Poison the whiskey
* Anger the bull


## O'Hara Ranch
Shooting a lantern-holder as they stand over an oil patch will kill all characters on the patch and not trigger an alarm

If you invisible kill-carry the long coat in the field from the left side with Hector, you're close enough to the bushes to drop the long coat where you are and his body will disappear.


## Eagle Falls
If Kate or Cooper are on the left side of the bridge when you blow it up, you'll fail the mission. Blowing up the bridge doesn't cause an alarm.


## Devil's Canyon Chapter 2
You have no normal attack to use for ghost setting, but you can still create a ghost to perform glitches at doors and interactables.


## Baton Rouge
Nothing particularly noteworthy.


## Mississippi River
Rescuing your characters:
* Isabelle can teleport out of her cage and will gain invisibility if you do so.
* Unlock Cooper by killing the two enemies shooting the boat from the sandbags then having a character stand on the front of the boat.
* Unlock McCoy by entering his trapdoor.
* The objectives for freeing Hector and Kate won't be fulfilled if you teleport them out of their cages. However, they will if you fly them out.


## New Orleans
You typically need to get the right letter, meetup, then examine the desk in the locked shed to beat the level.

The letter you need is randomly assigned to one of the 3 targets upon loading the level. Reloading a save even at the very beginning of the level won't reset who has it. You can tell if you have the right letter by the dialogue played.

Each character gives different lines of dialogue if they're used to enter the shed and/or examine the desk. These lines are different lengths and presumably affect how soon the level ends (I haven't tested this much).

The letter and meetup can be skipped by using the out-of-bounds glitch to run straight to the shed desk with a controller.


## Queen's Nest
Wayne is unlocked by passing through his cell door with a character or showdown ghost.

Igniting the Queen typically causes an alarm, however if your characters are all on the boat without an alarm when the burn cutscene plays, it'll immediately transition to the end cutscene, which you can skip and immediately end the level.


## New Orleans Docks
You can use the out-of-bounds glitch to go straight to Frank and bypass the meetup.


## DeVitt Goldmine
The full map is unlocked when either all three characters collect their gear, or if a character or showdown ghost passes through the first gate.

Cooper and Kate are considered rescued and become available once their cell doors are unlocked (no need to pass through).

If you free Cooper/Kate before blowing up the final gate, the level ends when you blow up the gate. If you blow up the gate before rescuing them, you'll have to do an additional meetup with all characters at the gate.


## Las Piedras
Nothing particularly noteworthy.


## Casa DeVitt
DeVitt is immune to cutscene progression and will always begin in the same location. DeVitt must be tied up to end the level.


## Devil's Canyon Chapter III
In the final showdown:
* Your characters have about 4 seconds to fulfill scheduled actions upon executing showdown before Frank's bodyguards shoot Cooper
* The bodyguards can be either killed or knocked out or mind controlled, but distractions won't work
* The bodyguard named Bilya the Kid won't shoot Cooper and can be completely ignored


# DLC Levels - Money for the Vultures

## Casa DeVitt (Abandoned)
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## DeVitt Plantation
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## Eagle's Nest
You can teleport with the chest of money using a Blocked Door Teleport glitch.


# Challenges

## One Woman Army
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## Vanishing Act
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## Untitled Voodoo Mission
Hector will wake up if he takes damage.

When the mayor's on stage, the dog must be on the steps or the stage for the bark to work.

The priest can open locked doors when mind controlled. (Can other enemies do this? I haven't tried)


## Hazards of the Trade
Nothing particularly noteworthy.

## Public Transportation
Nothing particularly noteworthy.


## Three Men With No Name
The three targets are in the following locations:
* Near the boat, walking with the two long coats
* At Rosie's cabin in the top-right
* Along the road in the bottom-right near the gossiping doctor

The model target inside the bank won't react to seeing you.


## Bear Trap Triplets
Isabelle can be unlocked by stepping onto the bridge. This is optional.

The window for killing the three targets "at the same time" is narrow, the three have to die within about one second of each other.


## Best Served Cold
Nothing particularly noteworthy.


## Rescue Aid Society
The animals can't crouch and thus can't perform most glitches.

McCoy becomes available once his cell door is unlocked.


## The Devil is in the Details
This level has a lot of dialogue, and the level won't progress until you've fully listened to each full dialogue. If you trigger a dialogue while another dialogue is playing, the new dialogue will queue and be played once the first dialogue finishes. (I'm not sure I've fully explored what happens if two dialogues get queued)

English audio has the shortest total dialogue time. Next are German, Russian, and Chinese, respectively.


## Contact!
Enemies won't approach you while the gatling is firing.

Each guard house has two waves of alert guards. An enemy must alert inside that guard house's region to summon a wave of alert guards.


## For a Few Bullets More
The train can be used to kill enemies.


## Bird Hunting
The light by the long coat target can be extinguished by walking over him after he's been knocked out.


## What If?
There's a short timer before the level ends after killing Frank.
