## Blocked Door Teleport
You can teleport from anywhere into any door an enemy is passing through. You can perform this teleport while carrying a body or item (i.e. the Eagle's Nest treasure)

Method
* While an enemy is passing through a door, try to walk your ghost through the door
* Once your ghost gets blocked, press SPACE + SHIFT

This doesn't work with locked doors.
