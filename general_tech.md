# Game Settings

## Custom Keybinding
Execution can be made easier by customizing key mappings in Options > Controls

Personally, I use these custom keybindings:
* Execute showdown mode = R key
* Use mode (interact/pick up) = CAPSLOCK
* Rotate camera = Q & E keys


## Custom Difficulty
For categories without difficulty restrictions, Beginner difficulty generally allows for the fastest strats. However, customizing certain factors to "harder" settings can be even faster.
 
Select Beginner difficulty, then customize the following based on the level:
* Enemy set-ups: Fewer enemies can enable certain strats not possible with more enemies, but having more enemies can give you better options for creating showdown ghosts for glitches
* Showdown time pause: Time pause can be exploited to avoid detection/death, but time pause off can allow other actions/events to progress while you're in showdown mode setting up glitches (fast forward can also be used for this though)
* Detection speed: Slow detection helps avoid undesired alerts, while fast detection can be used to trigger strategic alerts faster

## Bounty Mode
Bounty Mode is not permitted in any category at the time of writing. Even if it were used, it would be of limited help since most levels have meetups which would be slowed by extra characters.


# General Tech

## Fast Forward
Fast forward (FF) makes everything move faster, so you'll want to have fast forward turned on as much as you can manage in categories where it's allowed.
 
Toggled vs Press-and-Hold
* In Gameplay Settings, you can choose whether you control FF with a press-and-hold or by toggling it. Toggled FF + time pause off Showdown is recommended, but it's possible different settings could be better in specific situations.
* Showdown Mode with time pause off cancels a toggled FF, while time pause on will maintain toggled FF upon exiting showdown.
* You can unfreeze time in time pause on Showdown Mode using FF. If you have toggled FF turned on going into Showdown, hit FF twice to unfreeze time (pressing once turns FF off, pressing against turns it back on and unfreezes time).
* You can't activate FF for ~2 seconds after leaving showdown mode (unless it automatically resumes from being toggled on before entering a time pause off Showdown).


## Camera Movement
* Double press your character's number key (1: Cooper, 2: McCoy, etc) to slide the camera to their location
* Click the minimap to snap the camera to any location without a camera slide

When a map isn’t yet fully revealed, you can still access some things just off the edge of the screen you’re not otherwise able to by rotating your camera to specific angles.


## Cutscene Progression
Enemies always start in the same spots when a level is loaded, and most enemies will progress along their routes as cutscenes play. When using in-game time, let cutscenes play until enemies are at the best positioning for you. A few enemies start in the same place regardless of when a cutscene is skipped.


## Strategic Alert
You can manipulate enemies by causing a well-planned alert. Enemies detecting you, a dead body, or hearing a gun shot will alert and move toward the offending stimulus. Other nearby enemies will also be distracted by this.
 
Note that you can't trigger meetup points while an alert is still ongoing.


## Strategic Damage
It can be useful to take damage in some niche situations:
* Allows McCoy, Isabelle, and Hector to use their heal ability to set a ghost position
* Allows Hector to use his whiskey heal ability to knock out another character when linked to them by Isabelle
* Wakes up wakeable allies


## Drop Kill
KO'd characters will die if they are dropped off a ledge and land 2 or more stories lower.


## Quick Locked Door Entry
Doors will become unlocked before the red circle icon completes. You can enter as soon as the unlocker squats down.


## Long Coat Takedown
By default, only Hector's attack (kill or KO) will take down a long coat without dying. Damaging a long coat will down them, and in that state any character can take them down unless they're in the long coat's view cone. 

If you're in a downed long coat's vision and exit it (by crouching behind an obstacle, etc), they will forget about you immediately and their view cone will snap back to the direction that they were injured from.


# Character Abilities

## Action Speed
Different characters have different speeds for equivalent actions. When you have options, choose the fastest character for the task

Run
* Fast: Isabelle
* Medium: Cooper, Kate
* Slow: McCoy, Hector

Attack
* Fast: Cooper, McCoy, Hector
* Medium: Kate
* Slow: Isabelle, Hector Long Coat kill

Body Carry
* Fast: Hector
* Medium: Cooper, Isabelle
* Slow: McCoy, Kate 
 
Teleport Set-up
* Fast: Hector
* Medium: Cooper, McCoy, Kate, Isabelle


## Isabelle: Mind Controlled Enemies
Enemies mind controlled by Isabelle can walk through locked doors, but the door remains locked to your characters.

They can also interact with objects, but can't trigger events like freeing Wayne in Queen's Nest or examining the desk in New Orleans.


## Isabelle: Mind Control Link Damage
Link Isabelle with another character, then mind control an enemy. The linked character will take damage, stunning them if they're a long coat and killing them if they're another enemy type. This can also be used for strategically damaging allies.

## Isabelle: Mind Control Carry
Mind control an enemy, then knock out Isabelle. She can continue to control the enemy while an ally carries her somewhere else.

## Isabelle + Hector: Whiskey KO
Link injured Hector and another character, then have Hector drink his whiskey. The other character will get knocked out.

## Hector: Body Throw
Throwing bodies with Hector is a quick way to knock out enemies, especially long coats.

## Hector: Rope Tie Skip
Hector can pick up a knocked out enemy without tying them up if he’s already holding another body. 


# Event Triggers

## Meetup Points
To trigger a meetup, all characters must be within an invisible region around the icon. It can be useful to experiment to find exactly where the boundaries are for each meetup.
 
Your character won't activate a meetup if they teleport directly into a meetup region, they have to walk across the boundary of the region from the outside.
 
Meetups won't trigger while an alarm is ongoing.


## Drop Points
Some objectives require that you place a body in a certain location. Alarms don't affect this from being fulfilled.


## Door Triggers
Some events are triggered by having a character pass through a door. These can also be triggered by having a showdown ghost pass through the door.


## Fly Triggers
Flying characters can hit event triggers, but not ones requiring you to pass through a door, even if you fly through it.
